451 Research recently published their annual report, “Top 10 IT trends for 2019.”

This report identifies the following trends for business leaders to be aware of:

1. 'Cloud native' takes center stage
2. Successful organizations will be 'data driven'
3. Focus in digital procurement shifts to optimization
4. A new 'Age of Automation'
5. 'Edge' computing becomes more tangible
6. The context economy begins to flourish
7. 'WorkOps' emerges to enable intelligent knowledge-based work
8. Security shifts to a 'zero trust' model
9. A new silicon gold rush
10. M&A dynamics shift to outsized exits

Of particular importance, Research 451 notes that: “As the digital opportunity continues to evolve, it will become increasingly necessary to take a broader perspective: true insight will come from examining the way technologies overlap.” To accomplish this, companies will require solutions that enable them to derive value from their data wherever it is located — in the cloud, at the edge, or on-premises.
