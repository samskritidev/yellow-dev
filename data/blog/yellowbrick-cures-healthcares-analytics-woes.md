Healthcare organizations are more reliant than ever on analytics as they seek to answer more complex questions using increasingly larger data sets. A [survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/industry/life-sciences/digital-transformation-biopharma.html?id=us:2el:3pr:4di4797:5awa:6di:MMDDYY:&pkid=1005656) by Deloitte with MIT Sloan Management review found nearly two thirds (62%) of digitally mature biopharma companies have already implemented a data-driven project at scale.

Yellowbrick Data delivers a modern data warehouse that sets the foundation for turning data into fast, actionable insights, helping the healthcare sector improve patient outcomes, accelerate time to market, drive cost reduction, and enable entirely new business models and revenue streams. With Yellowbrick, healthcare organizations can process Clinical Quality Measurements (CQMs) faster, integrate and share medical data like Electronic Health Records, store, process, and correlate all patient information, all while protecting privacy rights.

Example use cases for Yellowbrick in the healthcare sector include:

**Predictive analytics to improve care**

* Identify and resolve patient deterioration for issues like sepsis (response to infection)
* Identify patients that are high-risk for suicide or self-harm
* Assist diagnosis with predictive modeling over much larger sample sizes
* Improve population and patient health by risk scoring chronic conditions

**Improve personalized treatment planning**

Provide personalized care faster and better based on data including real-time status and treatment as well as deep patient history.

**Improve customer satisfaction**

Optimize patient flow, staff facilities for peak hours, and providing real-time visibility into wait times for patients and responders.

**Better monitor patient vital signs**

Continuously monitor data streamed in real-time from smart, connected devices to detect changes and predict a patient’s need for intervention.

**Leverage electronic health records (EHR)**

Analyze and broadly share EHR data securely, across the globe, to improve treatment quality, eliminate waste on items like redundant testing, and reducing the number of patient-doctor visits.

**Accelerate genome processing and DNA sequencing**

3-10x performance can dramatically improve productivity of researchers and shorten time to market for clinical applications.

**Accelerating drug discovery**

Enable simulations to run faster on much larger datasets.

**Reduce risks and fraud**

Run analytics on patient records and billing to detect anomalies such as a hospital's overutilization of services within short time periods, patients receiving healthcare services from different hospitals in different locations simultaneously, or identical prescriptions for the same patient being filled in multiple locations. Importantly, Yellowbrick also implements proven methods of data protection – such as access controls and multi-tenancy – to protect against malicious attacks and intrusions.

**Operate in a HIPAA-compliant hybrid cloud**

Yellowbrick data protection features ensure data meets HIPAA regulations whether it is stored in the datacenter or your chosen cloud.

**Improve operations**

Predictive modeling can identify cost inefficiencies, waste, risk, and streamline processes. Some examples include:

* Minimizing no-shows. Identify patients at high risk for missing appointments to send extra reminders.
* Identifying patients at high risk for readmission that might result in Medicare penalties
* Optimizing the supply chain to ensure supplies are ordered at optimal times and in optimal quantities to ensure availability of inventory at the lowest cost.
