The move by IBM to discontinue support for the Netezza product line has IBM customers facing a hard choice. On one hand, they can undertake a lengthy and complex migration to the IBM DB2 mainframe product â€” one that is far more complex and costly than Netezza users are accustomed to. On the other hand, Netezza users could consider cloud-only options, renting a data warehouse solution that might appear to have better economics.

However, these solutions become costly when run 24x7, and are unlikely to provide same type of performance as Netezza, especially for a large number of concurrent users. Their additional limitation is the inability to run on-premises. This has left Netezza and other traditional data warehouse users without options. Until now.

Read the white paper, [Breaking through Netezza End-of-Life](https://ww2.yellowbrick.com/hubfs/Whitepapers/YB_Migration%20Guide_Netezza.pdf ), to learn how the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse provides a fast, seamless migration to a platform that prepares you for the future.
