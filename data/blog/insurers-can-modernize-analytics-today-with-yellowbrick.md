Data is having a huge impact on the insurance industry. Insurers are using insights from analytics to develop  products and services that meet specific customer needs based on data from social media and wearables, predict patient risk using Big Data analytics, and dramatically improve the accuracy and speed of fraud detection. In fact, about 50% of Insurers see data analytics as a technology that will have the most impact on the industry.
