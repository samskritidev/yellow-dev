PALO ALTO, Calif. -- JUNE 5, 2019 -- Yellowbrick Data today announced it has secured $81 million in Series C funding to meet the global demand for the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse within the enterprise analytics market.

Yellowbrick successfully built a data warehouse for the analytic needs of the world’s largest enterprises.

These customers have seen dramatic improvements in analytic performance while significantly reducing costs.

To help enterprises gain control of their analytic processing, Yellowbrick provides a predictable and fixed pricing model that customers can apply to data center and cloud deployments, ensuring that they can rapidly scale their business while maintaining the utmost in fiscal discipline.
