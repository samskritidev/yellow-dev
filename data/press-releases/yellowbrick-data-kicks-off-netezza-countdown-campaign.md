### Yellowbrick Data Warehouse Offers the Most Compatible and Easiest Upgrade Path for Netezza Users

**PALO ALTO, Calif** - Dec. 11, 2018 - In six months, IBM will end support for Netezza Twinfin and Striper data warehouse product lines, forcing enterprise customers to find new solutions for their business-critical analytics. With its hybrid cloud solution, Yellowbrick is the simplest, most compatible [upgrade for Netezza customers](https://www.yellowbrick.com/netezza/).

Many of the world’s largest companies have chosen the [Yellowbrick Data Warehouse](https://www.yellowbrick.com/products/data-warehouse/), including: one of the top five credit card companies, one of the world’s largest insurance companies, a top North American wireless carrier, one of Asia’s largest private-sector couriers, a global top 10 hospitality and casino operator and the top electronic medical records provider.

Data and analytics continue to be a top priority for enterprises. James Curtis, senior  analyst at 451 Research notes,

> “Emerging innovations will continue to fuel enterprises to require the most from their data warehouses, in order to run in any environment, to access all of the data, to carry out the most sophisticated analytics and to maintain the highest performance.”

Describing the Yellowbrick impact on getting the most of their data, a large telecommunications service provider shared,

> “We compared the performance of a ​six-rack Netezza Twinfin​​ to the 12-inch Yellowbrick system​​ and performance was anywhere from ​3 to 50 to 100 times faster​​.”

With the July 30, 2019 deadline looming for Netezza customers, Yellowbrick Data has introduced its “Netezza Countdown” solution at [www.netezzacountdown.com](http://www.netezzacountdown.com), featuring a Netezza End-of-Support Countdown Clock, “Breaking Through Netezza End-of-Life” executive white paper, and more.
