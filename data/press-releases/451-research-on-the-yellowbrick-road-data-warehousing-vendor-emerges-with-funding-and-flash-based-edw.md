451 Research has detailed its look at Yellowbrick Data and released its first report on the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse: “**On the Yellowbrick road: data-warehousing vendor emerges with funding and flash-based EDW**.” Senior Analyst James Curtis spent time speaking to Yellowbrick co-founder and CEO Neil Carson to get an in-depth understanding of the industry challenges Yellowbrick solves with the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse and the technology that makes it all possible.

> _“After years in the making, Yellowbrick has emerged from stealth with an on-premises, flash-based data-warehousing system aimed squarely at large enterprises looking for flexibility in carrying out operational analytics.”_

Per 451 Research: “_to understand_ \[the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse\]_ is to understand the company’s reasoning for coming to market_.” The Yellowbrick Data Warehouse is designed to address the shortcomings of the market: lack of high availability, inability to run ad hoc queries, poor scalability, inability to run mixed real-time workloads, and challenges handling high concurrent numbers of users.

How does the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse address those problems?

> _“Yellowbrick provides a differentiated flash-based architecture that allows data to bypass the RAM and feed directly into the CPU cache, providing a compelling and potentially cost-reducing scenario.”_
