**Release 5 Extends Leadership in Price/Performance, Availability, and Security**\

**PALO ALTO, Calif. — November 16, 2020 —** Hybrid cloud data warehouse company [Yellowbrick Data](https://www.yellowbrick.com/) today announced significant product innovations for optimizing enterprise performance, availability, and security and debuted a new entry-level offering that provides the power of Yellowbrick to enterprise customers with smaller-scale use cases.

“Data warehouses are becoming absolutely business-critical,” said Neil Carson, CEO of Yellowbrick Data. “Release 5 strengthens our product for demanding fault-tolerant applications, and our new Standard Service Plan extends the power of Yellowbrick to smaller use cases than before. Businesses of all sizes know that real-time data and analytics power their competitive edge. We’re committed to their success.”

**Yellowbrick Data Release 5**

Yellowbrick Data Release 5 delivers new capabilities that further strengthen Yellowbrick’s position as the leader in price/performance, including:

* **More investments in business-critical reliability and performance.** Customers already depend on Yellowbrick’s Advanced Workload Management to help enable speed-of-thought insights 24x7x365. Release 5 adds rapidly self-healing clusters for fault tolerance. In addition, query visibility in Release 5 is more granular, giving users subsecond control of a query across its lifetime.
* **Finer-grained security.** An updated security model now allows customers to fully protect their data warehouse with finer-grained security, limiting the number of super users.
* **Faster query building with SQL functions**. Developers can be more productive and save time building queries with new support for SQL user-defined functions.

"Next-generation, enhanced Release 5 Workload Management features promise further performance and control in an already strong ‘big data’ warehousing and analytics platform,” said Steve Emmerich, chief architect at ACI Worldwide, a Yellowbrick customer that powers [digital payments](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aciworldwide.com%2Fabout-aci&esheet=52313877&newsitemid=20201027005089&lan=en-US&anchor=digital+payments&index=7&md5=316eee6834c169be8d5f093061026101) for more than 6,000 organizations around the world. More than 1,000 of the largest financial institutions and intermediaries, as well as thousands of global merchants, rely on ACI to execute $14 trillion each day in payments and securities.

“We’re seeing a renaissance in analytical database products that can power next-generation data warehouses and data marts, but not all players address the need for hybrid- and multi-cloud deployment,” said Doug Henschen, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research. “Deployment flexibility remains very much in demand, and it’s a wish that goes hand in hand with the desire for fine-grained control over cost and performance.”

**Standard Service Plan**

Yellowbrick Standard Service Plan offers the price/performance and hybrid cloud flexibility of the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse for smaller-scale use cases, including new data warehouse initiatives, dev/test environments, departmental data marts, and Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle upgrades.

The plan is priced at $10,000 per month. For a limited time period, this offering is available as a free 30-day trial.

Additional details on the Yellowbrick Standard Service Plan and other Yellowbrick configurations are available online at yellowbrick.com/pricing.
