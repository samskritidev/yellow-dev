Yellowbrick Data is pleased to announce its latest industry honor, earning a spot on CRN’s list of [“The Coolest System and Platform Companies”](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/cloud/the-coolest-system-and-platform-companies-of-the-2020-big-data-100/16) as part of the publication’s 2020 Big Data 100. CRN is a leading source of news, analysis, and perspectives for solution providers and technology integrators, and the 2020 Big Data 100 is its annual ranking of the “most important big data technology vendors that solution providers should be aware of” as data becomes an increasingly important enterprise IT asset.
