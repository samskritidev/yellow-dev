Yellowbrick Data brings simplicity back to analytics by delivering the ultimate data warehouse. Recognizing that business analytics were constrained by outdated data warehousing products, Yellowbrick co-founders set out to reengineer the entire data warehousing stack. The Yellowbrick Data Warehouse, a turnkey appliance based on the Yellowbrick architecture for native flash queries, powers analytics on-premises, in the hybrid cloud and at co-location and edge data centers.

“Yellowbrick has been a key partner in helping transform our Big Data analytics efforts. The solution enables us to achieve a 360 degree view of our clientele, allowing us to provide a strategic advantage to tailor meaningful solutions for our clients and analyze preferences and behaviors across millions of data points in real time,” said Jonathan Ozark, EVP Chief Strategy and Analytics Officer, Melco Resorts & Entertainment. “Yellowbrick has accelerated our traditional BI tools and is also powering the data needs of our predictive algorithms.”

“The unique architecture of the Yellowbrick platform gives us the ability to rework our data lake and data warehousing infrastructure, including key initiatives for consolidation and the hybrid cloud,” said Chris Sindoni, Chief Data Officer, Allscripts Payer and Life Sciences. “The Yellowbrick system works well with our existing analytic tools like Informatica, while improving our overall analytical throughput and performance. We completed extensive testing of major MPP data warehouse platforms and found Yellowbrick to have the highest performing, most scalable and cost-effective platform for our 300TB environment.”

Providing further evidence of the need for a hybrid cloud solution, in the IDC 2018 Cloud and AI Adoption Survey, 80 percent of the 400 IT decision-makers said their organization has migrated either applications or data that were primarily part of a public cloud environment to an on-premises or private cloud solution in the last year.

In total, Yellowbrick has raised $92 million in funding. Leading venture capital firms DFJ, GV, Menlo Ventures, Samsung Ventures, and Third Point Ventures provided $44 million in Series A funding. The Yellowbrick Data Warehouse was made generally available in September 2017. Previously announced customers include [Symphony Retail AI](https://www.yellowbrick.com/resources/case-studies/symphony-retail-ai/) and [TEOCO Corporation](https://www.yellowbrick.com/resources/case-studies/teoco/).

**INVESTOR QUOTES**

“The data warehousing industry is overdue for a shakeup, and we believe the Yellowbrick vision for an integrated software and hardware solution for the hybrid cloud is the right path,” said T.J. Rylander, Next47 partner.

“We have been seeing explosive demand for robust enterprise solutions across analytics and hybrid cloud, and Yellowbrick is poised to capitalize on this opportunity,” said Sam Fort, partner at DFJ Growth. “DFJ Growth is thrilled to join the Yellowbrick team at this exciting stage for the company.”
