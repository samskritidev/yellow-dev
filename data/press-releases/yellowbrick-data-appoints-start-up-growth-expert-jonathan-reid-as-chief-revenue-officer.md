Yellowbrick is uniquely poised to help companies transform through extraordinarily fast insights, with a price performance level unheard of in the industry.”

Reid joins Yellowbrick as the company prepares for its biannual summit where it plans to announce a new cloud product roadmap, opening new markets and addressing new use cases. The Yellowbrick Summit is planned for April 29, 2021.
