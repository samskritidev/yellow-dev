PALO ALTO, Calif. — July 29, 2020 — Hybrid cloud data warehouse company [Yellowbrick Data](https://www.yellowbrick.com/) today announced that data security solutions provider [Protegrity](https://www.protegrity.com/) has joined the company’s partner program to offer customers advanced data security and privacy. The companies have completed technical integration and certification to offer enterprises worry-free, powerful solutions that protect the most sensitive data at the world’s biggest companies.  

“Protegrity delivers leading-edge data security and privacy solutions to the world’s largest enterprises across the leading platforms and data stores,” said Allen Holmes, vice president of business development at Yellowbrick Data. “Combined with the power and scale of Yellowbrick’s hybrid cloud data warehouse, enterprises can enjoy faster time to insights without worrying about compromising sensitive data and while also adhering to protection and privacy regulations.”  

“Yellowbrick offers a unique hybrid cloud data warehouse that serves our enterprise customers well across all their data needs—whether in the cloud or on premises or both,” said Michael Gephart, executive vice president of sales and alliances at Protegrity. “Every day, businesses collect, move, and analyze massive amounts of data. However, the ability to access and use that data safely has not kept up with the accelerated rate of innovation. Through our partnership with Yellowbrick, we are delivering on our commitment to secure sensitive data wherever it resides, freeing enterprises to unlock the value of their data.”  

Protegrity’s data-protection platform allows enterprises to choose the data they want to protect and determine why it must be protected; find the sensitive data distributed throughout the organization; protect the data and keep it private at all costs; enforce policy rules to determine who is authorized to view “clear data”; and monitor and maintain control over who can access what data, where, and when.  

The Protegrity partnership is part of Yellowbrick’s ongoing strategy to build the most complete and robust partner ecosystem in the data warehousing industry. Thanks to a familiar, standards-based PostgreSQL front end, customers can confidently deploy Yellowbrick knowing that they can leverage their existing database infrastructure and employee skills with innovative pioneers such as Protegrity—without having to worry about complex integration.
