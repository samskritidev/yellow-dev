Researchers in countries around the world are aggressively tracking the spread of COVID-19, modeling new diagnosis approaches and treatment plans, and even in some places beginning human trials on vaccines for COVID-19. At Yellowbrick, we’re making even more resources available for free to accelerate their efforts.    
 
Today, we announced that we’re expanding our free COVID-19 solution to include advanced data center services from ScaleMatrix, which include HIPAA-compliant solutions critical to medical and healthcare researchers.   
 
You can read our [press release with ScaleMatrix](/press-releases/yellowbrick-partners-with-scalematrix-to-expand-free-solution-for-covid-19-vaccine-research) and if you are a researcher or company actively working on a COVID-19 vaccine, you can find more information at yellowbrick.com/covid19/ and sign up for our free solution.   
 
With Yellowbrick Cloud Data Warehouse running in ScaleMatrix Data Centers, companies actively working on vaccines can connect data from a broad range of sources (such as clinical trials, media information, test and tracking information, and other research) into an analytic and compute platform designed for delivering time-critical insights.    
 
Those insights are essential to the rapid and successful development of a vaccine to stop this pandemic.    
 
All of us at Yellowbrick are honored to play our part.
