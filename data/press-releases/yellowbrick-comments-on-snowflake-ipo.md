CEO Neil Carson Offers Perspectives and Is Available for Interviews

PALO ALTO, Calif. — September 15, 2020 — Hybrid cloud data warehouse company [Yellowbrick Data](https://www.yellowbrick.com/) today offered perspectives on Snowflake’s IPO, and the company’s CEO Neil Carson announced he is available for media interviews. Yellowbrick is uniquely positioned to provide insight on Snowflake’s IPO because it is the only other modern data warehouse company founded in the last eight years. Yellowbrick’s approach differs from Snowflake’s, with a focus on hybrid cloud versus cloud-only, because the vast majority of enterprise data needs today and for the foreseeable future demand a hybrid cloud approach combining on-premises, cloud, and multicloud solutions.

“I want to personally congratulate Snowflake on what appears to be a truly massive IPO,” said Carson. “This IPO validates that the market for data warehouses is large and growing. Yellowbrick and Snowflake share a common vision that data warehouse modernization is important and a top priority for businesses grappling with formidable economic, social, and customer behavior changes. Our own Yellowbrick approach to data warehouse modernization is focused on the enterprise and hybrid cloud applications that solve the vast majority of enterprise data needs that are not cloud-only. Snowflake’s IPO is a definite win for our industry and for the businesses Snowflake serves as well as the enterprises we serve—all of which are desperate for new data and analytics approaches.”

Carson is available for additional media interviews and perspectives via Yellowbrick’s PR agency, Bospar Communications, at [prforyellowbrick@bospar.com](mailto:prforyellowbrick@bospar.com).
