PALO ALTO, Calif. — April 13, 2021— [Yellowbrick Data](http://www.yellowbrick.com/) announced its lineup for the company’s virtual online gathering, [Yellowbrick Summit 2021](https://www.yellowbrick.com/go/summit2021/), including technical sessions, keynotes and customer and partner panels. The event, scheduled for April 29, is designed for data analytics, business and IT leaders who need to transform their businesses through better use of analytics insights.

At the summit, Yellowbrick will offer details on its revolutionary data warehouse [designed for distributed clouds](https://www.yellowbrick.com/products/distributed-clouds/). The company’s highly-performant core product now targets emerging use cases in IoT and edge analytics, as well as continuing to enable near-real time business analytics across private and multiple public clouds.

“Data is becoming more distributed across private data centers, multiple clouds and the network edge, creating significant data sovereignty and gravity challenges,” explained Yellowbrick CEO Neil Carson. “Yellowbrick led the industry in hybrid cloud innovation. Next,[ bringing our data warehouse to distributed clouds](https://www.yellowbrick.com/press-releases/yellowbrick-brings-data-warehousing-to-distributed-clouds-for-first-time-addressing-business-challenges-of-distributed-data/) will be transformative for businesses facing these challenges, especially as use cases like IoT analytics emerge in manufacturing, telecom and logistics.”

Key partners will join Yellowbrick at the summit to discuss this next level of innovation in the cloud space.

“Distributed-cloud data warehouses will soon be part of every IT ecosystem, consolidating multiple business function-specific data marts and databases into a single entity,” said Nandakumar Sivaraman, Practice Head of Emtec Data & Insights. “Deploying a multi-cloud architecture leveraging cloud principles such as containerization and secured packets will help businesses define a robust approach to enterprise data distribution, and Emtec will take a leading role in helping companies transform their analytics to take advantage of this new architecture.”

“Through our partnership with Yellowbrick and integration with its innovative data warehouse architecture for distributed clouds, we are helping enterprises to secure their data wherever it resides,” said Jay Chitnis, VP of Global Alliances and Partners at Protegrity. “As a result, we enable our mutual customers to unlock the power of all their data, including sensitive data, so they can run AI models to unleash new revenue streams.”

“Innovative organizations must have the ability to process data anywhere. We fully support Yellowbrick’s vision of a warehouse for distributed clouds,” said Vinay Mathur, Chief Strategy Officer with Next Pathway. “We see a unique opportunity for Next Pathway to automate the migration of legacy workloads, helping businesses leverage this ground-breaking architecture.”
