Heading to the [Gartner Data and Analytics Summit](https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/data-analytics-us) in Orlando on March 18 through March 21? We will be there! Here’s a list of the six sessions we’re not missing.

**Monday, March 18, 2019**

- **9am – 10am: Gartner Data and Analyst Summit with the Gartner Opening Keynote: Lead With Purpose to Achieve Clarity in a World of Ambiguity: [Carlie Idoine](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/43435/Carlie-Idoine), Sr Director Analyst; [Donald Feinberg](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/490/Donald-Feinberg), Distinguished VP Analyst; [Michael Mora](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/53445/Michael-Moran)n, VP Analyst; [Valerie Logan](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/56414/Valerie-Logan), Sr Director Analyst**
    - We will be kicking off the week with this session where we are delighted to learn how to lead with purpose in an ambiguous data-driven world.

- **3:05 -3:30pm: Gartner Zone: Selecting the Optimal Data for Big Datastore Architecture With Gartner's Technical Assessments: [Sanjeev Mohan](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/62886/Sanjeev-Mohan), Sr Director Analyst**
    - Later in the afternoon, we’re excited to understand the evaluation criteria Gartner uses to assess the different types and categories of data stores.

**Tuesday, March 19, 2019**

- **11:30am – 12:15pm: Data Storytelling: A Better Way to Engage Decision Makers With Data: [Neil Chandler](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/28904/Neil-Chandler), Managing Vice President**
    - After warming up with Ted Friedman, Rita Sallam, Michael Moran and powering up on coffee at the networking breakfasts, we can be found learning about how data storytelling offers a more engaging means of communicating findings than BI reporting or data visualization alone. It will be interesting to hear what new skills and techniques are needed to create compelling data stories.
- **2:15 – 3:15pm: Roundtable: Do You Feel the Need for Data Modeling or Is It a Practice of the Past? [Mark Beyer](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/25477/Mark-Beyer), Distinguished VP Analyst**
    - After lunch, find us discovering to what extent data should be modeled. We’re looking forward to hearing others’ experiences on how much data modeling is needed and where and when data modeling should happen.

**Wednesday, March 20, 2019**

- **5:15 – 6:00pm: The Future of Data Infrastructure in Digital Enterprise: [Donald Feinberg](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/490/Donald-Feinberg), Distinguished VP Analyst**
    - Before heading to happy hour, we will join the discussion on the database management market and how it is undergoing a rapid and profound transition as the supporting technology is changing. Cloud and dbPaaS is becoming the platform of choice and pricing models are under pressure from both open-source and the cloud. We’re interested in learning how the market will evolve

**Thursday, March 21, 2019**

- **10:45 – 11:30am: Ask the Expert: Key Trends in Data Management: [Adam Ronthal](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/52420/Adam-Ronthal), Sr Director Analyst**
    - We have our pencils sharpened and have our questions ready. We look forward to learning more about the future of data management.

Looking forward to seeing you all at the show! You can’t miss me: I’ll be sporting a bright yellow jacket and - on occasion - a bright yellow tutu!
