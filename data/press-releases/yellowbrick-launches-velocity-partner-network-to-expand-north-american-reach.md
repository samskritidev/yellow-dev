PALO ALTO, Calif.--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Hybrid cloud data warehouse company Yellowbrick Data announced the launch of its official channel partner program, the Yellowbrick Velocity Partner Network. The company’s profoundly fresh approach to data warehousing delivers game-changing simplicity, performance and return on investment (ROI) to meet customer needs.

"Within their larger computing ecosystems, midmarket through Fortune 500 global enterprises need the seamless integration of resources, data and analytics across hybrid and multi-cloud boundaries that Yellowbrick provides”

To kick off the program, Yellowbrick has entered into a distribution agreement with [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/ecs/na), a Fortune 110 value-added distributor. Arrow aggregates world’s leading technologies and services to enable its global channel ecosystem. Arrow’s cloud management platform, ArrowSphere, removes the complexity in the IT buying process by connecting these technologies with thousands of channel partners and millions of end-users through an extensive cloud catalog and consumption management capabilities. 

**Velocity Partner Network Means Turn-Key Integration**

“Within their larger computing ecosystems, midmarket through Fortune 500 global enterprises need the seamless integration of resources, data and analytics across hybrid and multi-cloud boundaries that Yellowbrick provides,” said Allen Holmes, vice president of channels and alliances for Yellowbrick. “Through our Velocity Partner Network, more customers in banking and financial services, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail and telecommunications will have the data-driven speed to answers they require, regardless of where their data lives. Because we offer the best performance and price-performance in the market, channel partners will benefit from excellent margins, as well as sales and technical training, leads and co-marketing support.
