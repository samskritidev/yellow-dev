        <span class="speaker">Marydee Ojala: </span> Hi, and welcome to the data summit, connect, lunch, and learn from Yellowbrick. I'm Marydee Ojala. I'm the conference program director for the data summit connect conference. And we're very lucky to have with us today, Justin Kestelyn who is vice president of product marketing for Yellowbrick. We do want this presentation, this lunch, and learn to be as interactive as possible. So if you have a question during Justin's presentation, click on the, raise your hand button down there and remember to unmute yourself so that we can hear you talk. Your other alternative is to type a question into the Q&A box. So either way we do want your questions. No question about that. So let me turn this over to Justin who is going to be speaking to us at our lunch and learn all about the how to invest in data and analytics during disruption, Justin,
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin Kestelyn: </span> Thank you very much. I'm very happy to be here with you all. I appreciate you showing up for your, for this lunch and learn as Marydee mentioned I'd really like this to be really interactive and think of it more like a workshop or a round table, but I want to sit up here and sit here in my secret location and just displaying slides at you for the next 20 minutes. Let's make this very interactive and conversational. So let me begin with my title slide today. We're going to be talking about investing in data and analytics during disruption and boy, are we in, in a disruption right now? Let me start off by telling you a little bit about Yellowbrick data. Yellowbrick data has the world's only modern data warehouse for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. And what I mean by that is that we provide a data warehouse platform that offers a combination of industry leading price performance at scale, which is actually far beyond what the legacy data warehouse vendors, and even the cloud only vendors can provide.
      </p>
      <p>
      	We provide the flexibility to consume analytics from anywhere whether it's inside your firewall in your own data center or from any major public cloud or both. So that's flexibility that you can't get from any other alternative. And finally, we offer this all through a simple fixed cost annual subscription with no hidden cloud fees. And I'm happy to answer any questions about Yellowbrick at this time or some other time in the future. So with that, let's get into our subject matter. So let's talk first about what your peers think about this question and and how are we going to do that? Well, Yellowbrick actually conducted a survey three or four months ago, we surveyed about a thousand. Its professionals, most of whom had titles of director and above this was in the U S and it was across multiple industries.
      </p>
      <p>
      	And we asked them exactly how they're approaching these investments during the pandemic. And we got some very interesting responses. So let's go through those first and I'd be very interested in hearing from you about whether your own experiences mirror what we found in the survey data. So the first question we asked is whether organizations are increasing or reducing their, or they expected increased or reduced budgets as a result of the, you know, this, this climate of extreme uncertainty we're in and surprisingly you know, I expected the answer to be, yes, we're cutting deeply. And the response was actually the opposite for a plurality of respondents. The budget is either flat or growing actually. So there isn't that much of a slowdown in investment in it right now. Again, I'd be very interested to hear about your own personal experiences, but with respect to this sample we're not seeing a huge impact on spending. There are some, a little bit I'd call it an incremental impact. But it's not as much as you might expect. And I think there's some reasons for that, which we might uncover in the rest of the data here.
      </p>
      <p>
      	You know, one of the things we asked is whether data warehouse modernization was an important investment area for these companies in the present time and in the near future. And the vast majority of them called it at least important, if not very important, that's 90%. So data warehousing is not not on the sidelines. It's something that professionals are increasingly interested in investing in. And I think there's some reasons for that, which we'll talk about a little later. But again, you know, I did not expect to see a number of this high you know, maybe 45, 50% would have been something I would have said, but 90% is a pretty, pretty tragic number with respect to data lakes, which has kind of the, you know, data lakes, kind of the data warehouses, evil twin, you know, how important is it to get business value out of your data lake this year, again, 95%, nearly 95% called it at least important, if not very important.
      </p>
      <p>
      	And you know, I think part of the reasoning here is that and again, in our experience, what we hear from customers is that for the most part I'm generalizing, but for the most part businesses are not getting actionable insights out of their data lakes today. Data lakes have simply not fulfilled their promise to provide or enable analytics at scale. Like we all hope they would. They're really, really, really good as vehicles for cheap storage for storing everything at a very low cost, but the analytics piece has been largely missing, unfortunately. And I think that this data reflects that fact that you know, companies can no longer afford to let past investments sit unused and untapped in this environment. It's super, super important that everybody take full advantage of the investments that they've made in this environment with respect to investing in analytics infrastructure overall more than 60% said that they will be investing more.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Again, not incredibly surprising that there's an increased interest in investing in data analytics because we're all struggling with understanding the new world, the new environment, new business models. And we, these changes are going to be with us for the immediate future, if not longer term. So it's not too surprising that data analytics is considered important. I'd be surprised to hear from a customer that data analytics is somehow less important. And so I actually expected this number to be higher, but clearly the inclination is to invest more in data analytics infrastructure with respect to why people are interested in making these investments. This is kind of all over the map you were in this particular question, you could answer multiple you could, you could say yes in multiple categories but generally speaking better performance is something that people are looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Obviously everyone wants to lower costs whenever possible, and everyone's interested in ease of use, but you know, if we had to pick one thing that stood out, it was better performance. And again, this is somewhat surprising. You would think in this, in this climate of uncertainty, people would be queuing most tightly to cost control. And we're not seeing that we're actually seeing an interest in getting more results, more results faster regardless of the costs, as opposed to strictly you know, the sole imperative of, of lowering expenses. So again, somewhat surprising. Okay, let's talk about some other things that at Yellowbrick data, we hear directly from our customers that might mirror or run in parallel to some of these results. You know, one of the things we're seeing is that our customers are seeing patterns of behavior that they've never seen before which is something, you know, we often call data drift and therefore they're analytic models that they've been using are broken, or they're either breaking or they're broken.
      </p>
      <p>
      	And just to give you some specific examples I was in a similar situation. I was in a round table a couple weeks ago where one of the people in the round table was an IT leader from a company that sells exercise equipment. And that makes videos and so on as well. And obviously they've seen this huge change from commercial businesses, from a more business to business model, to a direct business to consumer model because everyone's doing their exercising at home. So they're getting all kinds of new data that they'd never seen before and new, new patterns, new customers, customer behavior that they're not familiar with. So they need to rebuild all their assumptions and analytic models. Similarly there was a gentleman actually on the panel from legal zoom. And again, he's, he told us that in the past, most of their business was the business to business market. But now that people are at home all day, they have more time to do things like catching up on old legal paperwork, like maybe doing a will or a power or a healthcare directive or something that they've maybe kind of left by the wayside. But now they're at home actually a time to look into that and, you know, do the paperwork themselves. So again, they've had to adjust their business model, their analytic models to reflect who their customers are and how they're behaving.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Another thing we're seeing is that long-term strategic initiatives, which very, very commonly include cloud migrations are accelerating. So businesses are taking the opportunity. We're taking advantage of the uncertainties. He actually pushes the speed button on things that they plan to do on a long term basis before. And they're just, they're doing it faster. So they want to get to the ideal point in their IT infrastructure to help them deal with, with some of the changes that are happening kind of a mirror to that is that digital transformation is accelerating and accelerating and it's exacerbated. And again you know, that goes to the fact that you know, the huge brick and mortar businesses out there are struggling mightily, and everyone's moving to online to an online model where they can do it even restaurants.
      </p>
      <p>
      	And you know, that is the textbook definition of digital digital transformation. So we, there are those businesses that are seeing new data that have new data sources and new types of data and data that's coming at them in a real-time that real-time speed that they need to account for in their analytic infrastructure and that's new for them. So again, you know, that that is actually driving. I think some of the desire to migrate to the cloud, because there's a feeling that they're better, they'll have more agility and scale and ability to account for the digital transformation changes that they're saying in their businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
      	And then finally speed and flexibility are more important than ever. You know, they've always been important, but now you really can't afford to not get answers. You need immediately that things are changing so fast. You need to keep up with them. And there's just no room anymore for an analytic infrastructure that's just slow. It's just, it's not workable. So let's talk about evaluating priorities. This is actually my last slide, because I want to get into the discussion here, but just to give you some provocative questions to help guide your thinking about how you should be evaluating priorities, the way some of these customers have and how the survey respondents have. If, if you're one of those companies that's accelerating its journey to the cloud what are your drivers for doing that? On the face of it, it sounds like the right thing to do, but what is the actual, what is your expectation with respect to the benefits you'll get out of it?
      </p>
      <p>
      	Is it lower costs, increased agility to be able to do more releases more quickly, flexibility is it all of the above? Is it something else, you know, what is, what are the really underpinnings of your cloud journey? Because once you understand those, it can help you understand what kind of journey you need to make. In some cases you know, for some customers that'll mean a full data center exit, and, you know, jumping into the cloud with both feet, both feet and leaving the on premises world behind. But another case is there are companies that need a lot more flexibility for one reason or another. You know, they might have workloads, for example, that need to stay on premises because they're in a regulated industry, or they might have workloads that need to stay on premises, because it would be too expensive to migrate the data out from the edge to a data center somewhere else. So you really need to understand what your motivations are in order to make the right strategic decision with respect to the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
      	And if you're on that journey, can you afford to lock yourself into a single cloud provider? So again, if you feel like one of your drivers for a cloud migration is flexibility. Well, keep in mind that once you've made that full on data center, exit two into a single cloud provider, you've just lost that flexibility. You can cross that off your list because you're locked into that provider. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it's a bad thing, but it's important to understand the implications of doing making that kind of journey to the cloud because you, you will lose the flexibility of for example different consumption models you know, where your, where you're storing your data, the types of tools you can use, you know, that's, that's all going to be dictated by whatever cloud platform you're on for better or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
      	So again, I mentioned this before, you know, you might have workloads that would have special security compliance or data gravity requirements. That's something you need to account for on your cloud journey. And the other thing they account for is that elasticity, which is one of the major benefits of the cloud, has a good side and a bad side. The good thing about elasticity is that you only pay for what you, which is really Nirvana. That's the thing everyone's looking for. The challenge there though, is that that's really only good for workloads that you don't run that often because you don't want to have to pay for resources to be running workloads that are not running, but what about workloads that are running all the time? You know what, if you have an ETL process that's running 24 hours a day and an elastic model is going to be very, very expensive for that kind of workload.
      </p>
      <p>
      	So again, you need to understand, you know, where your costs are going to land and align those with whatever kinds of use cases are involved here. And it's also important to understand that you know, depending on your application, if you have an application that depends on very, very high scale, whether it's numbers of users or amount of data or both, you know, when you get to that high end performance can be somewhat unpredictable and unreliable. It's absolutely fantastic on the lower end for smaller data sets again, that are, that are elastic, that when you need a femoral resource that come and go absolutely fabulous. But when you're talking about, you're talking about applications that are more at the high end that's a different story and you need to evaluate that differently.
      </p>
      <p>
      	So given the data transformation challenges that we talked about earlier, if you have a data lake that's been sitting dormant for the last three, four or five years, can you afford to continue investing in that without a strategy for getting actionable insights out of it? I would think not, you know, particularly with respect to data trends, digital transformation, where you might be getting real time, data streams that are unstructured data, for example, from maybe from social media platforms and that's pouring into your data like all the time. And you're not getting anything out of it, you know, can you afford to do that? I would argue, no, you need a strategy for being able to get, get those insights out of your data, like, and to make it get some business value out of that data lake, by the same token, can you continue to invest in an aging data warehouse platform, for example, you know, if you're on an old platform you might have limits on how much data you can process within a given time period, you know, can you afford to, can you live with that?
      </p>
      <p>
      	Can you afford, you know, SLA windows that last, you know, a day or longer? Again, I would say in this time of uncertainty, we're agility and speed and performance are at such a premium, I would say, no, you know, you need to consider investing in infrastructure. That's gonna make you much more nimble and allow you to process much more data, much more quickly, so you can get answers and insights from that data.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Can you afford to wait minutes or hours for queries to complete, you know, that goes for data lakes and data warehouses. You know, we have customers that, you know, they have applications that the scale is such that, you know, they had queries that would last sometimes hours. And when agility is so important and you need those answers right away, you can't afford to wait hours for your query to complete those queries needed to complete within seconds, ideally, or even in milliseconds. And that's possible it can be done, but again, you need to set your priorities in the right way. So you can invest in the right technologies for making that happen. 
      </p>
      <p>
      	And that's all I'm going to present. I think that's about 15 minutes. I'd like to go to a group discussion. Now I love this slide where everyone's touching hands, because we're never going to see that again. Unfortunately I hate to say let's hope we do, but let's open it up for discussions. I'd love to answer questions, provoke discussion. Let's go for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>Okay. We have nobody's raised their hand yet, but do feel free. We do have sort of a comment from one of our viewers agreeing with you about there's a huge trend when people are considering budgets. And when you presented this, the slide right before this one about all these provocative questions and trying to evaluate the priorities, what, what are you finding with how different customers prioritize based on some of those questions? What are the key drivers that you're seeing?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>Well, I think, and again, it depends on the use case for customers who tend to be in, you know, bigger companies with more business critical applications that are always going to bias towards speed, performance, flexibility, you know, big companies don't like to be locked in you know, they're looking for strategies that are going to give them the, or retain the ability to make choices in the future. So in other words, to be future-proof, that's super, super important for a smaller business. Maybe it's not as important because you know, those aren't, you're not thinking that far along, but, you know, for companies that tend to have mission critical type applications, they definitely have that mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>So when you're talking about cloud, you, you talked about cloud just sort of in general, and then you also had the comment about Yellowbrick being a hybrid cloud business. Could you say a little bit more about what the hybrid cloud approaches really are?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>Yeah, absolutely. You know, hybrid cloud is something that's actually been in the news quite a bit. Some, some of the big vendors have made announcements about their hybrid cloud strategies. In particular, we've seen cloud only vendors like AWS and GCP. They're starting to develop on-premise options which would allow customers to take a hybrid approach. When I say hybrid approach, you know, hybrid is supposed to mean the ability to build a best of breed cloud that might include on premises, infrastructure and public cloud infrastructure. So in other words, you're not going all in on a cloud only strategy you're out. You actually have more of a best of breed approach where you're taking the best elements against a data center. What something you could do in a data center, for example, like have a highly engineered system that's designed for super high performance, combine that with the agility of cloud consumption, that would be a hybrid approach.
      </p>
      <p>
      	But the thing to keep in mind is that a lot of these vendors are using a hybrid model to lock you in more because once you're running on their customized hardware, you're really locked in. So what we would do is we would argue that you should use hybrid cloud as a stepping stone to a multi-cloud strategy that allows you to take advantage of all the major public clouds all at the same time. So you could use Google cloud platform for AI. You could use AWS for transaction processing, whatever the case may be. And again, that gives you the freedom and the choice and the flexibility to make whatever decisions you need to make in the future without being locked in. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>Okay. All right. We've got another question here. And again, I encourage those of you who are at our lunch and learn to ask some questions. This is your opportunity to quiz Yellowbrick on whatever you feel like wasn't going over good data lakes. Are they really still relevant?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>Data lakes are very relevant. Yeah. Data lakes are very relevant. I didn't mean that literally data lakes are very much kind of like the counterbalance to the data warehouse strategy. I think once upon a time we expected data lakes to replace data warehouses. We found out pretty quickly that that's not going to happen, or nor should it happen. Really what you want to do is use a data lake for what it's really good at, which again is very, very scalable, very, very low cost storage. And you want to combine that with a super high performance analytical layer, so you can get answers from your data lake very, very quickly. Unfortunately, the Hadoop ecosystem has not really developed a nut score. There's been a myriad of SQL on Hadoop alternatives in the last 5, 6, 7 years. None of them have really lived up to their promise, unfortunately. So instead we're seeing customers pairing a high-performance data warehouse with their data lake and using that data warehouse. Is that again, a high-performance analytical layer on top of that, that huge data store.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>So just following on from that, but does that mean you're seeing cloud data warehouses as the new standard?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>So I don't, I think they're good for what they're good for. I wouldn't call them a standard again, if your, if your data set is small and relatively, you know, relatively speaking, and again, if your workloads are such that you just want to spin up a cluster, use it for a couple of hours and kill it when it's done. Hopefully you remember to do that. They're, they're great. But if you're, if you have a workload that's running 24 7, and you need always on performance to get answers from your data, you know, always on high performance, predictable high performance is going to beat elasticity all the time. Again, elasticity is great for workloads that you don't run very much, but if you are running one a lot, then elasticity is not necessarily the best option for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>Oh, okay. Here's another question. We still use a 23 year old financial data warehousing data warehouse using older ETL technology, Oracle Cognos, Informatica impromptu on solar, Seoul, Solares Unix. What are the best upgrade replacement options or suggestions?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>Well I don't know exactly what your platform is. If it's 20 years old, it's probably-
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>23 years old, he says.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>-23 years old. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's Oracle, maybe it's an appliance. Like Netezza no, I would say that your best option or the one you should definitely look at is Yellowbrick for a number of reasons. You know, the number, that's a softball question, Marydee. I mean, number one, you're going to get probably 100 X performance. So we're what you're using today and maybe beyond, and it's going to be at a fraction of the price of what you're paying now. I can pretty much guarantee you that. So you should definitely In-Q include Yellowbrick in your, in your calculation there.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>Pretty funny. Okay. Actually that's amazing, isn't it? That people are still using things that are that old well, I mean, I guess berries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>Yeah. People have made investments and it makes sense. You want to continue to keep that investment viable, but when you get to 20-25 years of hiring armies of DPA's to like squeeze every ounce of performance out of these things by, you know, quaint tuning queries and building indexes and kinda like souping these things up, and you're only going to get so far with that. You know, at some point you have to think, you know, what, we need to change the game and modernize and move to a platform where we're going to get that a hundred X performance that we want. It's going to be a lot easier to manage, and we're going to have flexibility to move to the cloud if we want to do that. So it's worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>Yeah. I mean, when you think back 23 years, and what was the state of the art with technology and it's nowhere near what we see today. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>Yeah, absolutely. And you know, in the last 10, 15 years with the exception of the cloud the legacy world, we haven't seen a whole lot of investment in the data warehousing platforms. I think a lot of that is because Hoodoo had it kind of sucked all the oxygen with respect to innovation in that area. And you know, now is the time to make that jump because there are very interesting alternatives for you. You don't have to-
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>I feel that Hadoop is kind of fading.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>Yeah. Well, again, you know, it's great for storage. It's just, when you, when you're talking about analytics and top of Hoodoo, you can do it. But, you know, we have customers that have had, have had hive queries that would take, you know, hours or even days to run, depending on the amount of data involved and days to run. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>That's just mind blowing. Really. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span> Some people, sometimes people don't know what the possibilities are, so they feel limited by what's in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Marydee: </span>Yeah. Well, if there are no more questions I want to thank Justin very much for presenting for us at this, a wonderful lunch and learning. And we'll, we hope to do some more of these. So thanks again, Justin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="speaker">Justin: </span>I enjoy the time and I'm happy to answer any questions in the future. If people want to get in touch.
