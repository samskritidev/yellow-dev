          <h2 class="text-gray-500">Modernize and Improve Performance</h2>
          <p>Enterprises have known for a while about the announcement of End of Life (EOL) and End of Service (EOS) of the IBM Netezza appliances and it was easy foresee that the aging technology would need to be replaced. IBM is retiring Netezza Twinfin and Striper models and has introduced a host of confusing replacements.</p>
          <p>This is the utterly perfect time for enterprises to evaluate other technology options. The need for innovation, speed and scale were key drivers for the adoption of Netezza more than a decade ago. Those same needs apply today. But enterprises don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past with appliances that were inflexible and unable to extend to the cloud.</p>
          <p>Cloud-only data warehouses come with their own challenges: data privacy and data governance needs often prevent enterprises from a wholesale cutover to the cloud and cloud-only data warehouses can be exorbitantly expensive or lack the compatibility-requirements of large enterprises. What choices are available for an enterprise that wants innovation, speed, scale and extensibility to the cloud for their data warehouse?</p>

          <h3 class="text-gray-500 pb-2">The Yellowbrick Advantage</h3>
          <p>Yellowbrick, the only modern data warehouse that runs on any cloud or on-premises, is the clear choice. Yellowbrick offers a unified hybrid cloud solution that enables enterprises to move their workloads where their business needs it – whether it be on-premises, or in the cloud, or both.</p>
          <p>Migration to a cloud-only data warehouse is complex and necessitates an entire rethinking of an enterprise’s data strategy. Organizations may not have the time and the resources to implement such a complicated project in a short timeframe. With Yellowbrick, organizations are not forced to move their data entirely to the cloud only but can build a cloud strategy at their own pace as business needs dictate.</p>

          <h3>With Yellowbrick, enterprises can:</h3>
          <ul class="rfs-text-base">
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Best Price/Performance:</span> Yellowbrick scales to the largest datasets – all the way to hundreds of petabytes with 100X faster analytics performance than legacy or cloud-only data warehouses all at a fraction of the cost. Yellowbrick has predictable subscription pricing with no hidden costs and no charges for data movement.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Innovation:</span> Yellowbrick is the only data warehouse that offers a cloud-native data warehouse or an optimized instance that is purpose built for hybrid cloud. With Yellowbrick, enterprises have a unified solution that spans on-premises to the public cloud – with no expensive retraining and minimal operational expense.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Agility: </span> Yellowbrick’s innovations enable enterprises to deploy a modern data warehouse with high scalability either in the public cloud, private cloud, on-premises or hybrid and mixed deployments. Yellowbrick can even be deployed at the network edge. Yellowbrick supports all major cloud vendors meaning enterprises are not locked-in to a particular vendor providing them with ultimate flexibility of deployment options.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Concurrency: </span>With Yellowbrick, organizations can support up to thousands of concurrent users on the same instance while maintaining the same level of high performance.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Reduced footprint: </span>  Yellowbrick helps enterprises meet infrastructure-reduction initiatives helping enterprises move their data warehouse to the cloud. And for those enterprises with on-premises requirements, the Yellowbrick optimized instance is small. An organization can shrink racks of hardware and shelves of disks to just 6U of space. Yellowbrick’s highly available architecture has no single point of failure and built-in redundancy so that enterprises don’t have to add extra instances for added resiliency.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Business continuity: </span> Yellowbrick provides the highest level of disaster recovery and replication to protect your data from any unforeseen circumstances or outages.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="pb-2">Migrate Easily and Quickly Away from Netezza</h3>
          <p>With Yellowbrick there are no complex strategies required to migrate data from Netezza. Unlike other cloud data warehouse offerings where enterprises have to agonize over which workloads to move to the cloud, Yellowbrick migrates all of an organization’s data in just days or weeks. Yellowbrick ingests data at a line rate of 10 GB/s or about 10TB per hour, ensuring that the migration completes quickly.</p>


          <h3 class="pb-2">Ecosystem Tools</h3>
          <p>Yellowbrick has a broad ecosystem program with partner tools that significantly speed up the migration of data from Netezza to Yellowbrick.</p>
          <p><strong>NextPathway</strong> is the Automated Cloud Migration company. Powered by the SHIFT™ Migration Suite, NextPathway automates the end-to-end challenges customers experience when migrating applications to the cloud.</p>
          <p><strong>CompilerWorks</strong> was founded with the idea of applying compilers and optimizers to new application areas. The task is one of the most challenging and most fundamental fields in computing: language design and implementation.</p>
          <p><strong>Systech</strong> provides end-to-end Digital Strategy, Data Engineering and Advanced Analytics services to build data-driven capabilities into clients’ core business operations to drive continuous growth.</p>

          <h3 class="-mb-8" style="padding-bottom:8px;">Customers Who Migrated from Netezza to Yellowbrick</h3>
          <img src="/uploads/customers/symphony-formatted.svg" alt="symphony retailAI logo" class="w-64 -mb-8" />
          <h4 class="pb-2">Symphony RetailAI</h4>
          <p>Symphony RetailAI provides AI-enabled decision platforms, solutions, and insights to leading grocers and retail chains around the world. The company needed a data warehousing platform that could help it minimize the time required to turn raw customer data into actionable insights—and get those insights back into customers’ hands to be put to use as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p class="-mb-8">Symphony RetailAI replaced five full-rack Netezza systems with six 6-U Yellowbrick appliances. The company has multiple Netezza workloads onto Yellowbrick, including the generation of analytics cubes, batch reporting, dynamic real-time reporting, and real-time queries from both analysts and its own applications. “Being able to easily support mixed workloads is another advantage of Yellowbrick,” says Nigel Pratt, Senior Vice President of Development. “We’re using its built-in workload management system to ensure that each workload will always have sufficient system resources.”</p>

          <img src="/uploads/customers/teoco-formatted.svg" alt="teoco logo" class="w-64 -mb-8" />
          <h4 class="pb-2">TEOCO</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom:12px;">For over 30 years, TEOCO (The Employee Owned Company) has been a leading provider of analytics, assurance and optimization solutions to the Telecom industry. They have over 300 communication service providers (CSPs) and OEM customers worldwide to whom they provide actionable intelligence about network quality of service and customer experience. TEOCO’s expertise and value-add to their customers derives from three core competencies:</p>

          <ol class="rfs-text-base">
            <li>Handling the extremely large volumes of data that telecom carriers generate</li>
            <li>Applying TEOCO’s deep industry knowledge and understanding of this data.</li>
            <li>Developing algorithms that transform this raw data into actionable insights</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Teoco needs faster insights and decision making that, in turn, drives the need for faster data warehousing platforms to deliver these insights. TEOCO is always looking for breakthrough data warehousing innovations; a need that became more crucial in late-2017, when IBM announced the end-of-life of many of the Netezza data warehousing appliances.</p>

          <p>Teoco evaluated many next generation data warehousing solutions including those from IBM and Yellowbrick. TEOCO’s proof-of-concept approach was an exhaustive, three-month process that, for most vendors, showed only modest performance improvements while revealing many issues around migration, data load and systems portability. Yellowbrick however, exceled in overall performance, data loading capabilities and query compatibility. </p>

          <h3>Key Benefits When Migrating From Netezza to Yellowbrick:</h3>

            <span class="rfs-text-3xl italic">"With Netezza, we had to move a copy of our data up to the cloud before customers could access it, and often ran into synchronization issues.

We’re delivering new insights to customers up to 12 hours faster each week by avoiding the need to move hundreds of gigabytes of data up to the cloud before it can be queried."</span>

Yellowbrick was three to five times faster, and probably just as significantly, they all ran to completion and produced the same results with virtually no tuning."</span>
