                    <h3 class="text-gray-500 mb-8">Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hedge funds are always seeking alpha. But these days, potential profits may be driven
                        more by data and analytics than by financial fundamentals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That’s why the need for both data and high-speed analytics for hedge funds has
                        exploded in the past few years. This is especially true with hedge funds’ use of big
                        data, alternative data, and data-powered investing. Analyses of increasingly large sets
                        of alternative data, from social media posts to news reports—and just about anything
                        else—can have a big impact on investment decisions. They can also highlight
                        important economic trends that provide new opportunities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Faster analytics and processing capabilities and more-flexible data strategies are
                        required to capitalize on the massive amounts of alternative data. They need to
                        enable fund managers and analysts to easily work with billions of rows of data in near
                        real time. Hedge funds need to be able to rapidly onboard information from both
                        local and cloud-based sources in a scalable and consistent way. And analysts need to
                        be able to use that data to quickly explore new ideas, create new models, and make
                        faster decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even hedge funds that don’t rely on alternative data are falling behind the competition
                        when it comes to real-time analytics. Market volume has exploded. For everything
                        from daily order processing to reporting and Order Audit Trail Systems (OATS) and
                        Consolidated Audit Trail (CATS) compliance, getting reports or critical analysis
                        completed in ever-tighter timeframes is becoming increasingly difficult with most
                        existing hedge fund systems. At the same time, controlling and managing risk has
                        never been more important, or more difficult.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Modern analytics with Yellowbrick Data Warehouse</h3>
                    <p>
                        Legacy platforms are too expensive, and vendors of conventional cloud data
                        warehouses offer unpredictable consumption-based pricing and have no incentive
                        to provide good performance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yellowbrick Data Warehouse is an advanced MPP SQL analytic database for demanding batch, real-time, ad hoc, and mixed workloads. Built from scratch for best price/performance, its adaptive “cut-through” architecture takes best advantage
                        of any physical (e.g., optimized instances) or virtualized (e.g., Kubernetes) infrastructure—delivering 100x performance for thousands of users
                        at a fraction of the cost of alternative data warehouses. On top of that, we add a modern, industry-standard database interface (PostgreSQL) that’s familiar to users for ecosystem compatibility. The result is a modern, quickly
                        provisioned, and easy-to-use solution that blows the doors off rivals in price/performance economics and that can be deployed anywhere across distributed clouds (private, public, and edge networks).
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="accent-heading mt-12">Top hedge fund and market maker</h6>
                    <p>
                        A top hedge fund and market maker found its existing database and analytics infrastructure
                        unable to keep pace with current requirements in a variety of ways. The company knew it
                        needed to modernize its SAP Sybase IQ legacy technology to keep up with modern-day market
                        volumes. The legacy system was overly complex and provided poor performance. In addition,
                        the company was struggling with timely OATS and CATS compliance reporting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After evaluating a range of options, the hedge fund selected Yellowbrick for its solution and
                        achieved significant results:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Yellowbrick performance was 10x the nearest competitor.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Daily order processing dropped from five hours to four minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Yellowbrick enabled near real-time ad hoc reporting for reports that previously took hours.

                    <p>
                        A major top-10 hedge fund faced multiple challenges with its existing analytics platform. The
                        company needed more speed and fl exibility from the platform, which wasn’t keeping up
                        with current business needs. The legacy Microsoft SQL Server and KDB proprietary database
                        for time-series Trades and Quotes (TAQ ) data was unable to meet critical performance
                        requirements. In addition, the new solution needed to leverage standard SQL and standard
                        tools for seamless analytics by existing users. And the solution needed to support a hybrid
                        environment, with the ability to deploy both on premises and in the cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After evaluating both KDB and SQL Server upgrades, the hedge fund selected Yellowbrick for its
                        new analytical platform for the following reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Yellowbrick’s performance was exceptional. The system loaded 1 billion records in less than
                            three minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Yellowbrick was the only solution to meet the company’s research performance requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Yellowbrick met or exceeded performance requirements for future predictions of extreme
                            workloads and disaster recovery situations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Yellowbrick’s hybrid architecture provided ultimate fl exibility with its ability to deploy both on
                            premises and in the cloud.
                        </li>
