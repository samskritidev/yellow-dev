          <h4 class="text-gray-500">Overview</h4>
          <div class="text-gray-500 mb-8 md:mb-0">
            <p>This major insurance company, with more than $90 billion in annual premiums, has numerous use cases for fast, reliable data processing and analytics, including:</p>
            <ul class="rfs-text-base">
              <li>Compliance with IFRS 17, one of the most significant challenges to insurance accounting in more than 20 years.</li>
              <li>Processing billions of insurance policies to assign the costs incurred for each policy across different areas.</li>
              <li>Insurance underwriting, for which 200+ users interactive analyze huge amounts of historical data.</li>
              <li>Claim ratio calculation (the ratio of the net claim settled by the insurer to the net premiums collected), which relies on complicated algorithms.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4 class="text-gray-500">Existing architecture failing the business</h4>
          <p>The company's patchwork of legacy data warehouses were too slow, inflexible, unreliable, expensive to support these use cases, slowing the pace of business and limiting the amount of accessible data:</p>
          <ul class="rfs-text-base">
            <li>Policy expenses could only be subdivided four ways, and multiple days were required to process the entire portfolio.</li>
            <li>Insurance underwriting was too slow due to latency when running ad hoc queries, with only a subset of data available for analysis.</li>
            <li>The solution lacked the performance and scalability needed to meet IFRS 17 compliance requirements.</li>
            <li>Claims ratio calculation took two full days to complete for the full portfolio.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="text-gray-500">Modernizing for price/performance at scale with Yellowbrick</h4>
          <p>After extensive testing and evaluation, the company selected Yellowbrick over Greenplum and others for its data warehouse transformation project -- with queries running 400X faster on Yellowbrick.â€¯During testing, Yellowbrick proved out its ability to help process and analyze billions of rows of data (including numerous complex table associations), providing price/performance at scale, data consistency, and 24/7 availability.</p>
          <img src="/uploads/images/Insurance_customer_chart.png" alt="Performance testing results: Yellowbrick versus competitors (in seconds)" class="my-8 w-full" />
          <p>Today, the company is using Yellowbrick to bring instant insights to asset management, annuity insurance underwriting, life insurance marketing campaigns, and HR (for 2 million employees).</p>
          <h4 class="text-gray-500">Results include:</h4>
          <ul class="rfs-text-base">
            <li><strong>Hundreds of underwriters can create policies more quickly and accurately for customers</strong>, contributing to a reduction in average turnaround time from 3.8 days to 10 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Capabilities now in place for compliance with IFRS 17</strong>, with the company being the first in its country to meet that milestone</li>
            <li><strong>Policy expense processing now completes in 2 hours (versus several days)</strong>, with costs subdivided into hundreds of different areas to drastically improve management accounting decisions</li>
            <li><strong>Claim ratio processing completes in 2 hours (versus 2 days)</strong>, while other processes are running concurrently without performance impact</li>
