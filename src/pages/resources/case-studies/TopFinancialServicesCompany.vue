          <h4 class="text-gray-500">Overview</h4>
          <div class="text-gray-500 mb-8 md:mb-0">
            <p>Every day, this multibillion-dollar company ingests data about millions of transactions into a data warehouse environment to support partner and co-branding programs, merchant services, reward points programs, and more. Thousands of analysts require immediate access to this data throughout the day, with workloads highly mixed.</p>
          </div>


          <h4 class="text-gray-500">Too many legacy platforms, not enough speed</h4>
          <div class="text-gray-500 mb-8 md:mb-0">
            <p>Previously, the company used Netezza, DB2, and Apache Hive to access and analyze data in a MapR-based data lake. Instead, the company envisioned the use of a single modern data warehouse platform to meet speed, scalability, and price/performance requirements for all its use cases.</p>

            <ul class="rfs-text-base">
              <li>Previous platforms couldn’t adequately support thousands of users running mixed workloads on large data sets, with users becoming frustrated.</li>
              <li>Some data loads took multiple hours, while some queries completed in minutes (or if at all).</li>
              <li>Disparate systems added to management complexity and overhead.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4 class="text-gray-500">Faster analysis on more data with Yellowbrick</h4>
          <div class="text-gray-500 mb-8 md:mb-0">
            <p>After evaluating Yellowbrick, Greenplum, Vertica, MemSQL, Databricks, IBM, and Teradata on four criteria (performance, concurrency, ease of use, and ease of migration), the company selected Yellowbrick after a successful POC in which a single Yellowbrick Data Warehouse instance beat a 20-rack Teradata 6800 in 238 out of 240 queries. Yellowbrick is now the company’s analytics platform of record for Accounts Receivable/Compliance, Merchant Reporting, Credit Card Rewards Points Calculation, and Consumer Loan Analysis, with additional applications under consideration.</p>

            <h4 class="text-gray-500">Results include:</h4>
            <ul class="rfs-text-base">
              <li><strong>Faster decision making across the business</strong>, with some queries running up to 100X faster across multiple departments at a fraction of the cost-per-query.</li>
              <li><strong>More accurate results</strong>, with five years of transactions (totaling nearly 2PB) available for queries.</li>
              <li><strong>30X faster access to new data</strong>, with some data loads that used to take 10 hours now completing in less than 20 minutes and available for queries immediately --enabling much fresher data for analysis. </li>
              <li><strong>Rapid migration (lasting approximately one month)</strong>, with most queries and stored procedures moving to Yellowbrick with minimal changes required.</li>
              <li><strong>Significant data center savings</strong>, achieved through sharply reduced rack space, power, and cooling requirements</li>
